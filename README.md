SNHU-CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main goal was figuring out how different data structures, like binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists, actually work in practice and when to use them. Each project was about choosing the right tool for the job.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I tried to look at what each structure was good at and where it struggled. For example, some are faster for searching, while others make adding or removing data easier. Thinking about those trade-offs helped me pick the right approach.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I got stuck, I usually went back to basics. Sometimes I’d look up examples online, check documentation, or write a really simple version of the code just to test the logic before building out the full solution.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It made me more aware of performance. I started paying closer attention to how my code might run when the data gets bigger. I also realized recursion doesn’t come naturally to me, so that’s something I want to keep practicing.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I’ve gotten better at keeping my code organized and easy to follow. I think more about naming things clearly, leaving comments where it helps, and writing it in a way that makes sense if I—or someone else—have to come back to it later.
